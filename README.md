<h2>Download</h2>
You can download this bot  <a href="https://github.com/Lunat1q/Catchem-PoGo/releases/latest">HERE</a><br>

<h2>OpenSource</h2>
This project will not provide source code for everyone anymore, due to it being stolen and being sold.<br/>
We will continue to develop this project, absolutely the same as i did before.<br/>
However Source Code  will not be published anymore.<br/>
We will still continue to release compiled updates (on release tab as it was before) of this software, so this will not effect most of our users.<br/>
